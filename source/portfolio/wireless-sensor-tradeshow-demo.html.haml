  EnOcean needed a solution that visualized wireless sensor data entering through a serial port to a PC or laptop.
  Robert quickly came up-to-speed with our unique requirements, parsed through our RF data packets and yielded a visual
  demonstration that definitely captured the essence of what our technology can do. It was a pleasure working with
  Robert - I look forward to working with him again.
