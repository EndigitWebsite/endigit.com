%h2 About SquareBattle
%p
  SquareBattle is a game written in LabVIEW where you create your own team of squares to compete against 
  other peoples teams in an arena. It was created with the following goals:
%ul
  %li To be a fun way to learn about LabVIEW and Object Oriented Programming
  %li To promote community networking and bonding
  %li To provide a challenging game that allows players to be creative while rewarding well designed code

%h2 Requirements
%ol
  %li LabVIEW 2013 or newer development system.
  %li Video game experience. At the very least, you have to have seen somebody play a video game at some point in your life.
  
%h2 Getting Started
%ol
  %li Review the <a href='#rules'>tournament rules</a>
  %li Read through the <a href='/downloads/SquareBattle_Instructions.pdf'>SquareBattle instructions pdf</a>.
  %li Download the <a href=#source>official source code</a> for the tournament.
  %li Watch the <a href='https://youtu.be/2Ymi0hzkQ0U'>introductory tutorial</a> on youtube.
  %li Review the Demo team.
  %li Figure out how you are going to win.
  %li Build your very own SquareBattle team.
  %li Test your SquareBattle team against your workmates and the built-in teams like Sentinel and Pinwheel.
  %li Submit your SquareBattle team to us via email, add it to the <a href="https://decibel.ni.com/content/groups/squarebattle">community page</a>, or bring it yourself to NI Week 2016. Everyone that enters a team to compete will be given a USB stick for keeps. You can use your brand new USB stick to transfer your team of squares from your computer to the tournament computer where it will be thrown face first into the tournament.
  %li Sit back and watch as your team claws its way to the top of the list. The tournament will be mostly automated with ELO type rankings. Be sure to submit your teams early enough that they can make it to the top of the list in time for the final showdown on Wednesday afternoon.
  %li Win the tournament. The final showdown will consist of the top ranked teams from the 1vs1 battles in the 150x150 sized arena duking it out to see who wins those awesome headphones.
  %li Go home and enjoy those new headphones you just won. Turn on the noise cancelling on your flight home and marvel at how wonderful it is to not hear the roar of the airplane. Wear them in your cubicle to let your workmates know you don’t want to be distracted and watch your productivity go up by leaps and bounds!

%h2#rules Tournament Rules
%h3 (subject to change)
%ol
  %li Each coder can submit as many SquareBattle teams as they want, within reason.
  %li The code will be reviewed before being placed into the tournament and we reserve the right to reject any code.
  %li 1vs1 battles will take place in a 150x150 arena. The winner is determined after 2000 rounds or 2 minutes, whichever occurs first. 
  %li Free-for-all battles will take place in a 250x250 arena with 16 teams at a time. The winner is determined after 3000 rounds or 5 minutes, whichever occurs first.
  %li Winners are determined by the team that has the most squares at the end of battle. The winner is determined semi-randomly in the rare case of a tie.
  %li The top teams in the 1vs1 battles will go on to compete in the final showdown, and the winner of that will be receiving the grand prize, BOSE QuietComfort 35 wireless noise-cancelling headphones.
