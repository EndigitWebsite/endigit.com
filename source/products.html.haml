%h2 Need to talk BACnet in LabVIEW?

%p
  BACnet is the ASHRAE Building Automation and Control networking protocol.  It is a flexible standard used in building
  systems such as heating, air conditioning, light control, fire detection, etc.  The standard itself is object oriented
  and lends itself to a LabVIEW implementation.
%p
  Endigit has extensive experience with talking to BACnet devices in LabVIEW.  We have developed a class-based API
  natively in LabVIEW that talks over both BACnet-IP and BACnet MSTP and could easily be extended to other BACnet
  supported interface layers. Please contact <a href='mailto:support@endigit.com'>support@endigit.com</a> for pricing if
  you are interested in the BACnet API.
%p
  Additionally, if you are in need of LabVIEW development involving BACnet, 
  looking for a starting point to talk to BACnet devices in LabVIEW or are simply wanting to collaborate on how to get started 
  with BACnet in LabVIEW, please contact us.  We're happy to help out at any level of involvement.
